Hereâ€™s how you can track the number of times the volume has been accessed using a **Python program** inside a **Docker container** based on `python:3.7-alpine`.  

---

### **Step 1: Create a Docker Volume**
Run the following command to create the volume:
```sh
docker volume create python_data_volume
```

---

### **Step 2: Create a Python Script (`track_access.py`)**  
This script will create a file inside the volume (`/data_folder/access_count.txt`) and increment the count each time the script runs.

```python
import os

# Define the file path inside the mounted volume
file_path = "/data_folder/access_count.txt"

# Check if the file exists, if not create it with initial count
if not os.path.exists(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "w") as f:
        f.write("1")
    print("Volume accessed for the first time.")
else:
    # Read the current access count
    with open(file_path, "r") as f:
        count = int(f.read().strip())

    # Increment and update the count
    count += 1
    with open(file_path, "w") as f:
        f.write(str(count))

    print(f"Volume has been accessed {count} times.")
```

---

### **Step 3: Create a Dockerfile**
This Dockerfile sets up a **Python 3.7 Alpine** container with our script.

```dockerfile
# Use Python 3.7 Alpine as the base image
FROM python:3.7-alpine

# Create a working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Python script into the container
COPY track_access.py /app/

# Run the script on container start
CMD ["python", "/app/track_access.py"]
```

---

### **Step 4: Build the Docker Image**
Run the following command to build the image:
```sh
docker build -t python-volume-tracker .
```

---

### **Step 5: Run the Container with Mounted Volume**
Run the container and mount the volume:
```sh
docker run --rm \
  --name volume_tracker \
  --mount type=volume,source=python_data_volume,target=/data_folder \
  python-volume-tracker
```

Each time you run the container, the script inside will increment and display the access count.

---

### **Step 6: Verify the Volume Data**
To manually check the access count, you can start a temporary container and inspect the file:
```sh
docker run --rm \
  --mount type=volume,source=python_data_volume,target=/data_folder \
  alpine cat /data_folder/access_count.txt
```

---

### **Expected Output**
When you first run the container:
```
Volume accessed for the first time.
```
On subsequent runs:
```
Volume has been accessed 2 times.
Volume has been accessed 3 times.
...
```

---

### **Conclusion**
- The script ensures that the access count persists across container runs using **Docker volumes**.
- **Python 3.7 Alpine** is used for a lightweight environment.
- The `track_access.py` script automatically updates and logs access counts in `/data_folder/access_count.txt`.
